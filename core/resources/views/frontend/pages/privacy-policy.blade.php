                            <p class="section-para"><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="font-weight:normal;">User Accounts that have not logged in for six months will incur a maintenance fee of up to $10.00 USD per month until either the account is terminated or reactivated for storage, bandwidth, support and management costs of providing hosting of the user's profile, portfolio storage, listing in directories, provision of the hire service, file storage and message storage. These fees will be refunded upon request by users on subsequent reactivation. Breach of the Terms of Service or Conduct may result in a fine, termination of the account or temporary ban depending on the nature of the violation. Furthermore, at all times, all parties are expected to conduct themselves with the utmost professionalism, decency, and ethics. Anything less than that will result in banishment from the job portal regardless of the package in question.</span></p>
