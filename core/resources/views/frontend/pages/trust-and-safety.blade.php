                            <p class="section-para"><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="font-weight:normal;">It’s important to have a clear idea of what you want when creating a job post or a proposal. As a freelancer, protect yourself by only accepting contracts with reasonable requirements. With escrow, clients pre-fund work and release funds to their freelancers as projects are completed or milestones are met – knowing that they’ll be able to review and approve delivered work before releasing payment. Escrow also gives freelancers the comfort of knowing that a project is funded before they begin working.</span></p>

                            <ul>
                             <li>Phishing: Prevent unscrupulous users from trying to steal your passwords. Double check that links or HTML files clients give you don’t lead to fake login pages.</li>
                              <li>Free work fraud: Don’t start work before the official contract start date. Never pay anything to work for a client, even if they claim that the money will be reimbursable.</li>
                               <li>Check cashing fraud: Report clients who ask you to process PayPal payments, or request favors to cash or deposit checks and money orders in order to send the money somewhere else.</li>
